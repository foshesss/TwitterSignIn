# Twitter Sign In
This is a pretty beginner level recreation of the Twitter sign in page. I noticed a couple of flaws that I didn't like with their sign in page and corrected them. (some spacing that bothered me-- the top padding on their page is a lot smaller than on the bottom for some reason).

My main goal was to recreate the page, not redesign it. This was created on a Mac. I believe it should look fine for other screens, but I didn't test if I'm being real with you.
